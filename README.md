### cmis-upnp-connector


With giubilo, we want to:  

* work out how to make the processes and tools large organisations use to organise stuff, practical for a household.
* learn how to use some open source application lifecycle techniques, tools and technologies.  
* have some fun and pass back what's been learned to the community.

Read the [project page](http://allegria.github.io) to see more about:  

* what we think Consumer Content Management is.  
* the motivation for doing this.  
* the idea.  
* what steps are on the roadmap to do this.  

Read the project [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/allegria/allegria.github.io/wiki) to see: 

* details about the concepts / modules being created.
* summary information, detailed steps and conceptual ideas for how we are getting there.

Read the project [Github issues](https://github.com/allegria/allegria.github.io/issues) to see: 

* requirements definitions.
* project tasks / issues / key decisions.
* bugs, enhancements etc.

It's still early days so there's not much in the bag yet but we'll get there.
Keep watching...
