/**
 * Addressing is Step 0 of UPnPTM networking.  
 * 
 * The foundation for UPnP networking is IP addressing through which 
 * devices and control points get a network address.  
 * 
 * Addressing needs to support IPv4 but can also include IPv6.  The 
 * device may be multi-homed and use Auto-IP, DHCP and DNS to simplify 
 * the configuration of the connections.
